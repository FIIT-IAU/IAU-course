## Important Notice
>
> The pair will present their results to the instructor in a Jupyter Notebook. One member of the pair will then electronically submit the report to the AIS system by:
> **26.10.2025 23:59** (Phase 1),
> **09.11.2025 23:59** (Phase 2),
> **30.11.2025 23:59** (Phase 3),
> **14.12.2025 23:59** (activities with bonus points).
>
> If the submission deadline for the project phases and activities in AIS is missed, late submission is possible **one week later**
> with a **50% penalty**.
> Later submission will not be accepted. Failure to submit any phase of the project or activities will result in not meeting the prerequisites for the exam (N).
